This is a quick overview of the overall project structure of regvue. It provides a high-level view of what each file does and where it is used in other files.

== .devcontainer/

Contains VSCode specific files dedicated to reproducing development enviornments.

See: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers

=== devcontainer.json

Defines VSCode specific settings about how to launch the project in a devcontainer.

It includes a list of extensions to automatically install when opening the project in a devcontainer.

It also exposes port 5173, which is Vite's default port used to run `npm run dev`.


=== Dockerfile

Defines the container used as a devcontainer. It is based on Node 18 and installs GitHub CLI.

== app/

Contains all the source code, test files, and configuration files for the regvue app.

=== cypress/

Contains all the configuration files and test files used for Cypress e2e tests.
All the folders/files were auto-generated except for the files inside `e2e/`.
The files inside this folder are what are executed by the `cypress run` command.
They are typically scoped to a single component or single behavior per file.

=== public/

Contains files that are meant to be available from the root URL when regvue is deployed.

==== app.config.json

Contains app-level configuration settings that can be changed for different deployments of regvue.
At the momement it contains a single config option `footer`, which controls the footer text displayed at the bottom of regvue.

==== example.json

Provides an example of the RDF and is used by Cypress to populate regvue for e2e testing.

==== include.json

Provides another example of the RDF and is used by Cypress during e2e testing to test `include` elements.

==== favicon.ico

Provides the icon image that is displayed in the browser tab.

=== src/

Contains all Vue and Typescript source files. The main entry point is `main.ts`.

==== components/

Contains all Vue components aside from the root Vue component defined in `App.vue` and the larger router views defined in `views/`.

===== AppVersion.vue

Defines a floating box in the bottom right of the screen that contains the regvue version and a link to the regvue repo.

===== BlockPage.vue

Defines the main page displayed by `ElementView.vue` when the selected element is a `blk` type.
It displays a `ElementTitle.vue` component, the element's `doc` property, and a table that displays the sub-blocks and registers that make up the block.
Each row in this table is created as a `BlockTableEntry.vue` component.

===== BlockTableEntry.vue

Defines a single row in the table displayed by `BlockPage.vue`.
This row will display the element's name, offset, and either the element's doc description or a breakdown of the element's fields if it is a `reg` type element.

Clicking on this element will expand it and show a mini-page with the element's doc description and a field table if the element is a `reg` type element.

===== DataFileInput.vue

Defines a drag-and-drop input box to open local data files and a url text input box to open remote data files.
When a file is opened or its URL is entered, this file makes a call to either `store.loadFile()` or `store.loadUrl()`.
On a successful data load, the component will reroute to the base URL.

This component is used in both `OpenView.vue` and `OpenModal.vue`.

===== ElementTitle.vue

Provides a formatted title section for `RegPage.vue`, `BlockPage.vue`, and `MemPage.vue`.
It displays the element's name, id, version (if set), and address.

===== ErrorWindow.vue

Provides a modal that will become visible if regvue encounters any errors in the window.
This modal provides a stack trace of what caused the error and a link to file a bug report at the regvue repo.

===== FieldInputBox.vue

Defines a single input box that is used as a part of the `RegLayout.vue` bit table.
This component is the input box that the user interacts with and handles input validation, provides a quick select for enumerated field values, and will display any errors with the input.

===== FieldName.vue

Used to format and auto-rotate the names of fields in the `RegLayout.vue` bit table.
This wraps the names with the `v-responsive-rotate` directive defined in `directives/ReponsiveRotate.ts`.

===== Header.vue

Provides the header bar visible in `ElementView.vue` routes.
This header includes the root name, the `Search.vue` component, any links defined on the root, and a button used to display the `OpenModal.vue` component to choose a new data file.

===== MemPage.vue

Displays an `ElementTitle.vue` component and doc description for `mem` type elements.

===== Menu.vue

Defines a tree menu that is included as a part of the `ElementView.vue` view.
This menu can be used to navigate to different elements.

===== OpenModal.vue

Defines a modal popup that serves as a smaller version of the `OpenView.vue` view.
This modal is opened by clicking on the button in the top right of the `Header.vue` component.
It displays a modal window with a `DataFileInput.vue` component that can be used to load a new data file.

===== RegFields.vue

Defines the field description table shown on `RegPage.vue`.
It includes columns for bit range, name, access type, and description.

===== RegLayout.vue

Defines the interactive bit table seen on `RegPage.vue` pages.
It provides a table with input boxes as well as buttons to change display types and reset to default values.

===== RegPage.vue

Defines the main page displayed by `ElementView.vue` when the selected element is a `reg` type.
It positions the bit table defined by `RegLayout.vue`, the element's doc description, and the field description table defined by `RegFields.vue`.

===== Search.vue

Defines the input box for the search, the window that `SearchResult.vue` components are displayed in, and uses the `createSearchIndex()` function from `search.ts` to create and query an index of the loaded elements.

Typing in the input box updates the search query and then this component displays the results.

===== SearchResult.vue

Defines a single formatted box that contains information about a returned search result.
Used to organize what is displayed as a part of `Search.vue`.

==== directives/

Holds all custom directives.

https://vuejs.org/guide/reusability/custom-directives.html

===== ResponsiveRotate.ts

Defines a custom directive that is used to automatically rotate text based on when it overflows it's container.
It is used in `BlockTableEntry.vue` and `FieldName.vue` to ensure that element names/offsets are rotated and displayed vertically if they would overflow their table cell when displayed horizontally.

==== views/

Holds defined "route" components.
When a user navigates to a route defined in `router.ts`, the route corresponds to a component defined in this folder.

===== ElementView.vue

Defines the main "element" view for regvue.
This includes orientating `Header.vue` at the top of the page, including `Menu.vue` as a collapsable pane on the left of the screen, and filling the remaining screen with one of three components based on element type.

`RegPage.vue` is used for `reg` elements, `BlockPage.vue` is used for `blk` elements, and `MemPage.vue` is used for `mem` elements.

===== OpenView.vue

Defines the "landing" view for regvue.
When a user navigates to regvue without a `?data` url parameter, this screen is shown.
It includes a welcome message and a `DataFileInput.vue` component to load a data file.
On a successful load it reroutes to `ElementView.vue`.

===== PageNotFound.vue

Defines the "404" view for regvue.
When the user enters a URL that does not map to a route in `router.ts` this view will be shown.
If the user also inputs a URL path that includes an element id, `ElementView.vue` will reroute to this view if that element id cannot be found in `store.elements`.

==== App.vue

Defines the root Vue component.
It provides a place for different views to be embedded in the `<router-view />` tag.
It also includes absolutely positioned components like `ErrorWindow` and `AppVersion` that are rendered regardless of route.

==== env.d.ts

Declares Typescript modules that are not already declared as modules.

==== index.css

Provides an entry point for Tailwind. It also provides a predefined style class that will apply default HTML styles.

==== main.ts

Main entry point for Vue. It creates a Vue app and initializes the store and router.

==== parse.ts

Provides utility functions that are used to parse string values and return either numbers or Bit arrays.

==== router.ts

Defines the router that is invoked in `main.ts`. 
It defines the routes, creates the router object, and specifies certain rerouting behavior based on if data has been loaded by the store.

==== search.ts

Exports a function used to build a Lunr search index object from a map of DesignElements.
It is called from `components/Search.vue`.

==== store.ts

Exports a function used to access a Pinia store object.
The store object also includes functions to read data, such as `loadUrl` and `loadFile`.

==== types.ts

Defines all custom types used throughout the regvue app.
It also includes a few utlity functions such as `isUnknownBit` and `isValidDataWidth` that are used to check types at runtime.

==== validate.ts

Defines functions used to validate uploaded data.
There are functions to validate both schema errors (i.e. syntax) and semantic errors (i.e. logical errors).
This functions are used in `store.ts` when loading new data files.

=== tests/

Contains Vitest unit tests.

== docs/dev/

Provides documentation files aimed at developers and maintainers of regvue.
This includes how to install regvue and host it on GitHub pages (`install-and-upgrade.adoc`), how to create a new release of regvue and publish to GitHub (`release.adoc`), and this file you're currently reading (`project-structure.adoc`).

== schema/

Documents the Register Description Format (RDF) used by regvue (we typically just refer to it as "the schema").

=== register-description-format.adoc

Provides documentation on the schema and all its properties and object types.

=== register-description-format.schema.json

Provides a https://json-schema.org[JSON Schema] formatted file that is used to validate data files and ensure they follow the RDF.

=== CHANGELOG.adoc

Documents any changes made to the schema itself.
Because the schema can be used outside of regvue, either for generation or outside validation, these changes are tracked separately from the base `CHANGELOG.md` at the root of the project.

== CHANGELOG.md

Tracks all significant changes to the regvue app.
It follows guidlines recommended by https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/[Keep a Changelog] and adheres to https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html[Semantic Versioning].
