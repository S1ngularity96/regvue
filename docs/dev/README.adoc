= Regvue Developer Docs

== Getting Started

To help new developers get started quickly and to ensure a consistent development environment across developers, the regvue project makes use of VS Code's devcontainer feature.
The project comes with a `.devcontainer/` directory that lets VS Code use containers to recreate the development environment from the OS all the way up to the VS Code extensions.

=== Prequisites

* Git

* VS Code

* Docker

=== Opening the project

Clone the project
```
git clone git@github.jpl.nasa.gov:regvue/regvue.git
```

Open the project in VS Code
```
cd regvue
code .
```

Open regvue in container

- Execute the: `Remote Containers: Open Folder in Container` command in VS Code and wait for the container to build

- See the https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_quick-start-open-an-existing-folder-in-a-container[devcontainer docs] for more info.

Run regvue locally
```
# must be run from the `app/` directory
npm run dev
```

More npm scripts can be seen at `app/README.md`.
